# Draayln's Veil

## THIS GAME IS MADE FOR PYTHON 3.12, DOWNLOAD CAN BE FOUND HERE: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](url)

There's two ways to play the game:
1. You can simply extract the zip, and double click "play.py", but coloured text will be lost.
2. Otherwise, you can run the play.py file in your terminal.

Ensure your game window is large enough for the map to display, otherwise the game won't work!
